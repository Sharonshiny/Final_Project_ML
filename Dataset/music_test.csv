Every girl is a something girl

She's got something
Every girl is a something girl
Every girl has a somehing smile
Every girl is a something girl
For a while
If I had three wishes I know mine
I would not ask the stars to shine
I wouldn't ask for gems or pearls
I'd ask for the something girls
Every girl is a something girl
From the whites of her eyes
To the tip of a curl
Every girl sends a something boy
With that something
When this old world won't treat you right
You're not feeling yourself tonight
Think of someone you can do
Relax and let that something through

And now I walk away from it, it's better done secret

Die in a crossfire runaway none of this exists
Someone is killing me

Turn him away, lay over there
His limb is red, I have all clear
Settle the wave I'm on my way
Dreaming of red, memories are worst

I feel abrasive worn and tired, don't think I could win
Take me to a place I adore and then seal me in

Well, these late night conversations
Leave a strange taste,
Like french cigarettes.
And these coloured drinks
that you keep on throwin' at me
Just keep on reminding me
I came to forget.

So now every night
You insist on reminding me
Of my lost possibilities
And the stains on the wall.
Well, I don't mean to complain
But it hurts just the same.
And now both of us know
The leaves will fall on their own.

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm goin' fast
I need love and it's you
And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool.

Yea, you tell me
Life is for living
It's best in the giving
But it's so hard to be free.
Still I do my best
But you refuse my gift
And now all that we share
Is a collection of tears.

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm going fast
I need love and it's you
And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool.

And there's not much I want to know

Steal their spanish grease making them shed a tear like willie bobo

A head crack will strike and attack for a sack
Pawn or sell your shit to buy a rock and bring that high back
That's why I strap it's my defense against those
Who are committing defense randomly becoming foes?
Shit is survival of fittest testing who's biggest and realest on the street

and the bad luck he brings

friends have fallen by the wayside
why isn't anyone talking to me
get those funny looks in the market

wander on with your hands in your pockets

three parts deceit
two parts shit that you made up

As I knelt to pray
I did not see the crevice yawn, no

At night I feel the end it is at hand
My pistol going crazy in my hand

You can hear the ambition mobbin' in my po position

Do your grindin' pay the boss before you floss
And don't lose your mind and find discipline'
And stackin' your scratch
So it don't come up missin' in
As you're askin' the Lord for guidance
While you ridin'
Stickin' and movin' slidin'
In and out the game
Unless you realize you're sprung before you legalize your funds
All you track hustlers that was made for the corner
Dodgin' the coroner's office
I'm tossin' this at you
Now on some sermon type shit
I'm burnin' and I gotta write this
The mic got me ballin'
Shot callin'
It's the murk one like that
Sit back but not in starship
So I don't tarnish or rust
When I'm bustin' on the next jerk
Who swears he's ballin' but can't network
You better off with sexwork
The way you fucked in the game

Gotta handle business before you choose to chill or you fall

Becomin' another nigga spawnin'

I've been crawlin' like a two toed
Chameleon for so long
Writing these songs and ridin' these thongs
With bracelets on they ankle bone
That's anxious to moan
Like Neena Samone
Have a trick
Sickin' thinkin'
That we know it's on
You better crawl before you ball man
Before you fall man
Keep ya hoes off your payroll
Unless they crawl with you
And you know they all with you
And even then they won't fall with you

I've seen so many many soldiers fall
They didn't know you had to crawl before you ball

Verse 3:
You see gotta put in major work in at first
Before you burst
Crawl before you ball but never lose your thirst
When you ballin'
Or you gonna end up broke and butt naked with no garments on
While I'm makin' more cheese than Parmesian
Learn game at a fast rate
Apply it to my walk then stalk
I won't fall off cause I'm a put in that work
And I'm a stick to that plan
Now I'm a stay down with my folleys
The team then turn and brace God gave green
Going, going till I'm gone

I want what will not judge me
I need what keeps me warm inside

A man without a purpose
Stares from the mirror on the wall
You think you know my problems
I think that you don't know my at all

I don't believe I suffer
Disease as you proclaim
And I don't believe that I should kneel and hang my head in shame

Held prisoner by a monkey
Strapped on behind my back
And while I sit ablaze 
The light is slowly fading into the black

I've got to medicate myself again
I've got to medicate myself again
I've got to medicate myself again

Cause you don't need me hanging 'round
One more drink and I will be drowned

I know you hate to see me
As I defeat myself this way
You know you can't control me
You know I'm slipping day by day

Down into my obsession
Down in the hole where I belong
And when this fight is over
You will stay right here and I will be gone
So I

I've got to medicate myself again    3x

And lying on the floor
An empty bottle in the drain
I put my hand right through the kitchen door

Crawling down my back again

The darkness calls my name
The trees are growing restless
They feel the season change
Their fruit has putrefied
Forbidden once and bound to die
The thread of life lies severed
On the brink of paradise

Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch 'neath her veil
Reclamation, our time has come
Our time has come

Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies

They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?

Will they know of majesty
Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their God of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from chaos roused for war?

War!

Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end

Again

To the comfort of your kin
Stain the milky sunset red
And let the others

And you killed it with I love you
What am I supposed to say back to you
And you killed it with I love you, with I love you

I know it's only
Only three little words that I seem to be so scared of
I'm so scared of
So please show me
How to get these words off the tip of my tongue and out of my mind.
I know that you're the one for me but it took me by surprise
But if I say it back to you
I can't look you in the eye
But I don't want to lose you
And I don't want to confuse you
I guess that this my cue to give you my reply

(Chorus)

I have been thinking about what you said
Three little words running round in my head
There's no one else that I'd rather be next to
I guess what I'm trying to say is I love you

It started with a low light
Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
They left a strange impression in my head

You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess I changed my mind

And you know I might have just flown
Too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name

And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
And that was the turning point
That was one lonely night

The star maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, ""Everybody look down.
It's all in your mind.""

Well, now I'm back at home and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
So hesitation to this life I give

You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You better look it over
Before you make that leap

And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night
Sometimes they justify my claim

And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised
But it was the turning point
Oh, what a lonely night

The star maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, ""Everybody look down.
It's all in your mind.""

Just to test her cause I ain't no jester
I suggest her and her friend be outtie
Cause I don't want to make my pals get rowdy
And doubt me our friendship
But when lips touch
I go crazy in the clutch
Sorta like schitzo I forgets my bros and pals over gals
I didn't mean to but when you fiend you do
Strange things for the denim no matter who's in em
Grab a flooze then I'm in traffic

John should of stopped before them drawers dropped

But then again I didn't know, sorry
Accept apologies and live on

Instead of tryin to front on me ya know
Thats exactly how I'm goin to be ya know

I know the rules on the flooze so who's short
I once had a ho who smoked blunts yo
She tried to get me so I looked at the front door
And now shes not with me so forget it

Seperate the weak from the ob-solete

Your heartbeat soun like Sasquatch feet
Thundering, shaking the concrete

Neighbors call the cops said they heard mad shots
Saw me in the drop, three in the corner

Slaughter, electrical tape around your daughter
Old school new school need to learn though
I burn baby burn like Disco Inferno
Burn slow like blunts with llello
Peel more skins than Idaho potato
Niggaz know, the lyrical molestin is takin place
Fuckin with B.I.G. it ain't safe

Bumps and bruises, blunts and Landcruisers

Stack mad chips, spread love with my peeps
Niggaz wanna creep, got ta watch my back
Think the cognac and indo sack make me slack?

One false move, get Swiss cheesed up
Clip to Tec, respect I demand it
Slip and break the 11th commandment
Thou shalt not fuck with raw C-Poppa
Feel a thousand deaths when I drop ya
I feel for you, like Chaka Khan I'm the don
Pussy when I want Rolex on the arm
You'll die slow but calm
Recognize my face, so there won't be no mistake
So you know where to tell Jake, lame nigga
Brave nigga, turned front page nigga

I would have loved you like no other babe
But a poet needs his pain
And sometimes life can be so cruel
It will pick you up and drop you down again

So if you try to love me darling please refrain
I'm still searching for the pieces
Someone else once took away
You know I used to love with all my heart
But how the times they can change.

Oh my babyâ€™s been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m a wounded heart.

Iâ€™ve seen a lot of heartache and Iâ€™ve walked a lonely road
They say the darkest times before the dawn
But the rooster hasnâ€™t crowed
And when you wake up in the morning
Oh my darling Iâ€™ll be gone
 
Oh my babyâ€™s been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m a wounded heart
No I still donâ€™t know if I'm a wounded heart.

So many fools fall in love
And itâ€™s a crying game
Itâ€™s a crying shame
That Iâ€™m not a fool in love
But I know what Iâ€™m feeling 
And my heart is still healing

Oh my babyâ€™s been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go

The first thing that I heard you say 
When you were standing there 
Set in your way was that you were not blind 
You were sure to make a fool of me 
Cause there was nothing there 
That you could see 
That could go beyond your mind 
Now who's standing at the door 
Remembering the days before 
And asking please be kind 
It isn't how it was set up to be 
But I've set you free this time 

I have never been so far out in front 
That I could ever ask for what I want 
And have it any time 
Knowing this you found a thought for me 
That told you just what I should be 
And there I stood behind 
With all the ones that went before 
And memories that always seems to 
Tear me from my mind 
In front of what it is you seem me to be 
I've set you free this time 

I could never find a chance to choose 
Between a way to win or a thing to lose 
Because there was your stand 
On top of all the love you took 
There was only something 
You can look at lying in your hand 
Now who's wondering what has changed 
And why it can not be arranged 
To have each thing work fine 
It isn't how it was set up to be 
But I'll set you free this time",Rock,sad,1998

Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun?

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of

Why? Why? Why God why?
Everything I love always seems to die
Answer me, speak to me, I don't hear you
Answer me, motherfucker I ain't scared of you
Is there even a God? Do you even exist?
What I gotta do to speak to you slit my wrists?
I'm talking to a God that I can't see
Can you see me? Can you see me?

(God)
Are you confused my son, and scared?
Let me make things more clear, so you're more aware

(Sticky)
Fuck who was that all this shit is freaking me

It is I God did you not say you wanted to speak with me?

(Sticky)
Bullshit I am talking to myself, I'm going insane

(God)
You are talking to yourself we are one of the same

(Sticky)
It can't be it must be the drugs I'm high
And if you are then why are we born if we live to die?
Is there life after death? What were we before birth?
Why is this whole earth plagued and cursed?
Is killing a sin is there life in other planets?
Is adultery wrong did you write the ten commandments?

(God)
Excuse me my son, one question at a time
We were never born, and we will never die
In the essence, there Is no such thing as death
How could I write commandments and not have them kept?
The soul is eternal you just change form
Then you come back with a new face on
You can not limit love unless you lack understanding
To answer you yes there is life in other planets
The futures a mystery the past is history
Today is a gift that's why it is called the present
Life is so simple unless you make it confusing
The wise ones stand us and the clever we are using

(Sticky)
Wait - God, there is so much I want to ask you
God, God? Where are you? God I need to talk to you

(Chorus)
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God

Tell me, are there psychics that can speak telepathically?

(God)
Yes but if you use more than one tenth of the minds capacity

(Sticky)
I can't think I feel life going down the drain
In the streets everywhere I am surround in pain

(God)
Don't think, your thoughts are just that- thoughts
Your feelings will really erase what you been taught
Feelings are the language of the soul the soul is truth
I speak through you to aware the youth

(Sticky)
But why let the suffering go on why not just stop it?

(God)
In order for anything to exist, so much is opposite
How can there be left if there was never right?
How can something know death if it never knew life?
How can you lose, if nobody won?
How can it be dark if there was never a sun?
That which is not grandeur, the soil still blessed
Form must exist for part of themself to manifest

(Sticky)
But I never asked to be born, I hate my life
And if you are God dammit then show me the light
And tell me- what's the meaning of life?

(God)
The process of all life
is an ongoing, never-ending process of recreation of self

(Sticky)
Is God a he or she is there one true religion?

(God)
I'm the Alpha, the Omega, the beginning and ending
We are all one and everything is living

Tonight...
The stars are aligned and the planets colliding
And the plan is arriving and she's out there smiling
The fear is upon us, the skies tried to warn us
Your parents are goners, no children to mourn
It's driving me crazy, this war is my lady
These bombs are our babies and God is amazing
The tick of the timer, the slip of your rival
The pimps and the rise of your pulse, where you'll find her
Hey hey 

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight

(Verse One - Lupe Fiasco)
Disease, the virus is spreadin' in all directions
No safe zone, no cure and no protection
No symptoms to find, the signs of an infection
No vaccines, remedies and no corrections
Quarantine your dreams and sever all connections
Don't let 'em in not a friend, not a reflection
Everybody's got it and wants you to have it next and
Don't accept 'em if you want to stay as an exception
No pill can heal the ill of this
Sickness some are still in doubt of its existence
Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance
Some say it's an exit, some say it's an entrance
The poor say the rich have the cure
The rich say the poor are the source
Revolutionaries say it's psychological war 
Invented by the press just to have something to report
Some say the first case came from a maternity ward
Some say a morgue, some say the skies, some say the floors
""Whores,"" say the nuns, ""nuns,"" say the whores
And everybody is sure
The scientists say, ""it only infects the mind""
The little boy said, ""it only infects the girls""
The preacher man said, ""it's gonna kill off the soul""
A bum said, ""it's gonna kill the whole wide world""

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her finger
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her finger
Streets are on fire tonight

(Verse Two - Lupe Fiasco)
Believe! Some say the neon signs by the loud speakers repeatin' that everything is fine
A subtle silence to demolish the trouble conscience of accomplished with no knowledge and every freedom denied
Every dream is designed and broadcasted from the masses to the masses from the antennaes on top of the shrines
Was fine and received and planted during the panic and surely it reports back everything in your mind
Everything is lyin', everything is dyin'
Everying is a rule, everything is a crime
Everything was here then everything rewind
New weather burned the feathers off everything flyin'
(And she likes it, and she loves it)
The sadness, the madness, the bad shit, the lavish, the fastest, the clashes
The ashes to ashes, everything intertwined
My femme fatale, my darlin' fallen angel
Once caught her changin' the batteries in her halo
Receipt for wings and everything that she paid for
And the address to the factory where they made those
The scientist said, ""she's already inside my mind""
The little boy said, ""what happened to all the girls?""
The preacher man said, ""she's gonna kill off the soul""
The dope boy said, ""it's the whole wide world""

And tear it from our side

Still agreed to disagree
You're connected to the heart
But tonight we'll set you free

So swallow the knife
Carve the way for your pride
Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Even now as I write this down
All pretensions disappear
Now our impulses will bite
At the ankles of our fear

So swallow the knife
Carve the way for your pride
Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Words are spoken
Words are broken down

So let's make this night
Be our best mistake
So let's take the time
To wipe the blood away

Now our hands are tied
And the world is caving in

Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Whoever is on the front line is gettin' struck first
We mercinaries, fuck turf
Every verse is varied, I bust first
Mayday, Natural Elements controllin' the ship
Rollin' a spliff that'll probably put my soul in a twist
But I remain bonin' a bitch
Got her buck-naked posin' for flicks
Actin' like she was never known for the shit
But I look over the shoulder and see the enemy lookin'
Physically strong but mentally shooken
And for penetentiary bookin's this shit happens
Get orders from my nigga Charlemagne the ship Captain
You sound like a bitch yappin' 
This shit is all Natural to us
Like blowin' endo out the window in the back of the bus
I move back and I bust
Rapid fire
You actin' flyer
Now your family's in black attire
With mad desire
When we caught you in the line of duty
You had it in your mind to shoot me
But every soldier of my kind sollutes me
Now I'm reclinin' with a Lucy
All of my niggas
Smoke it down to the filter
Holdin' a frown with a picture
You smell the smoke when I walk past
You saw blasts
You should've known about the drama in my warpath.

[Chorus]
Mayday Mayday, raise the white flags, time for the payday,
Payday, and it's like that, out shit is World Wide, North, South, East,
And West, put on your shield, lets see who's the best. Repeat 1x

[Verse 2: Mr. Voo-Doo]

You feel the burnin' emission
You squirm in submission
No terms and conditions
Ya'll confirm my suspicions
That ya'll are bitches that resemble Men
Like female Tennis players at Wimbledon
Why you tremblin'?
Shook like the ricter
My voice raise waves
And make ya'll change ways like crooks turnin Muslim
Blast shots burnin' your Bosom
Like bitch cramps
You got lucky your people told you switch camps
Or get damp with plenty led
I'm like a beast with many heads
Sort of like the Predators dreads
I got more arms than Dr. Octavious
Rock your whole block radius
I be the bomb
And I bleed nitrogliceren if you slice my palm
The Don been gone for how long from the rap biz?
Wet more domes than John the baptist
When the gat spits
It ain't over 'till the last man's limbs
Are twisted like he was doin Yoga
In fact my Pistol's longer than the Jokers
I ignite Mag's
Leave your toe wearin' a white tag
So, ya'll niggas better raise the white flag.

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3: L-Swift]

I swear theres a war in the air in the New York streets
You talk beef?
You had a swollen Melon, now you humble
With loaded weapons, nowhere to run to
We mega high, jet in the sky, droppin' bombs, 
Prepare to crumble as we rock on, 
Beware of the jungle with Anaconda's
Don't puff too much 'cause the enemy smells the Marijuana
We blastin' every object in Combat with honor
So yo, remember the agenda with the plan of action
No retreat, no surrender, keep the cannons blastin'
We blastin' heat 'till each member turns into has-beens
Soldiers bangin', who's click'll get done?
My crew can taste victory at the tip of the tongue
Always prepared physically, take the clip for the gun
And put it in, 'cause when it's on how many niggas'll run?
You said we couldn't win, bullets in ya flesh, cave in your chest
You pullin' for breath, I'm claimin' your death
You shouldn't've stepped, war paint on my chest
Fatigue green and black
And the heat reacts
To make you bleed like hemophiliacs
See me strapped, heavily armed, repetitively
Releasin' caps 'till the enemy's gone, definitely
My people pack metal for me, let a legend be born
I declare war, (What mothafucka!) and it's on.

Take a look at my once empty hand
See the rose that appears so real
Just like the one you saw in your dreams

Those who call me avatar
Know not what they're looking for
They just feed their flames with miracles
Just so you know
If you bathe within my light
You diminish your own might
The illusionist in everyone

As an outcast I faced defeat
Seeking comfort in this painful retreat
Made an oracle against my will
Word spread of miraculous skills

Premonitions call my name
I once doubted them all when they came
Now I embrace it and I'll never be the same

Those who call me avatar
Know not what they're looking for
They just feed their flames with miracles
Just so you know
If you bathe within my light
You diminish your own might
Illusionist in everyone

What I say and what I do was once potential
Sprung from the infinite place that dictates the seen

Those who call me avatar
Know not what they're looking for
They just feed their flames with miracles
Just so you know
If you bathe within my light
You diminish your own might

Where all the angels pray 
And if I close my eyes 
I'll see you there again someday

Left with our fragile hearts 
Still it's yours that's not beating anymore tonight 

Darkness is broken by the flame of our love 
Lost were we all and still through this we survived

Our sorrow kills our fears

In darkness we do what we can
In daylight we're oblivion
Our hearts so raw and clear
Are turning away, turning away from here

On water we have walked like the fearless child
What was fastened we've unlocked revealing wondrous wild
And in search for confirmation
We have jumped into the fire
And scrambled with our burning feet through uncontrolled desire

Chorus

There's a well upon the hill from our ancient past
Where an age is standing still holding strong and fast
And there's those that try to tame it
And the carve it into stone
Ah but words cannot extinguish it
However hard they're thrown

Chorus

On Racherie they have worked with their island dreams
By Lough Cleggan they have nourished in the mountain streams
And in searching for acceptance
They have given it away
Only the children of our children
Know the price they had to pay

Then I could save my calls

The east river when you are in love?
We're staring at all these lights
And I am going blind

Fill all of the Navy yards
With hard working security guards
'Cause the numbers are wearing off

In Paris on winter nights
Beneath a snowy veil?

Still breathing the fresh mountain air
I'll put on a diving tank

We moved out to the places, heart it races

Boom, da da, da da
Threw it out the window

Lately youâ€™ve been tanned
Suspicious for the winter with your

We moved out to the places, heart it races

I sold it to a man
And threw him out that window, he went

TRABUMO12903CBE25F.h5,Alice In Chains,Lesson Learned,"Just another lesson learned
Wear a scar, a bore repeating
Take a simple fateful turn
Opened up to stop the bleeding

Feeling like you never could
Been the disconnected frying
Hit the vein and struck a nerve
Seeing through a self that's blinding

Nowhere to buy in
Most of us hiding
Others are shining

Just another brick you toss
Stone the number one deceiver
Multiply the added cost
Easy to become a believer

Feeling like you never could
Been the disconnected frying
Hit the vein and struck a nerve
Seeing through a self that's blinding

Nowhere to buy in
Most of us hiding
Others are shining

You know when you find it
In your darkest hour, you strike gold
A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all

You know when you find it
In your darkest hour, you strike gold
A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all

Just another lesson learned...

You know when you find it
In your darkest hour, you strike gold

Profane and discreet
Make her move
Cross veins and chamomile

Soft and sweet
Seasalt silver-meat
Buried deep
In crowskin overcoat

Save your breath
This may be the last
There is no novelty here on the earth

O'saviour!
Forever threadbare and faded
Drunken and arcane
Curse the day

O'saviour!
There's rotgutted whiskey in ladles
For to ease the pain
Or drown away

And now I'm here to tell you.
I need you, right now.
I'll stay and we can work it out.
I can't believe, that you're still there for me.

You kept on forgiving me. You gave me everything...

My heart has found a cure.

You've lost that look in your eye.

But now we're standing face to face,
with nothing left to say but goodbye to yesterday.

I don't know if I'm that strong.
I don't know where we went wrong but somehow it's over.

In my dreams I feel you near me.

Like shooting stars we shine and then we fade,
breaking the promises we made.
What about the promises?
What about the promises we made?
What about our plans for forever?
Did they scare you?
Did you need to get away? 

You taught me many things.
Like how it feels to miss someone so bad it feels like a part of you is missing.
I can tell you one thing.
Now that you have gone I never will forget you.
You left your mark.
