3,A Century Ends,David Gray,308,angry,"Cast your eyes into the distance Try to focus on it all Find a spirit of resistance Instead of pride before the fall Forge some opposition From disparate strands It ain't the prettiest position As a century ends  Unstable situation Faces made of wax Streams of melting glass Sheets of butchered facts The roar of the machine Hooded hearts and jewelled hands And anger spilling out like gasoline As a century ends  Everything i seen, everything that i heard, Ain't even the tip of the iceberg Fire down memory lane So pass me my rose tinted glasses again  Through a fog of contradiction Out to the lake of tears See society admiring its own reflection Chase a light that shines and disappears Careful what you say 'cos reality offends Just sit back and let your soul decay As a century ends  And its easy to get weary As you fight to get it done gainst a popular theory That it's over 'fore it's even begun Strain the limit of compassion Tend a wound that never mends And honesty still out of fashion As a century ends As a century ends As a century ends....

But look here, until then Theyâre gonna buy your nice time So keep your wick in the air and your feet in the fetters To the day. You come in doing cartwheels We all go out by ourselves And your shape on the dance floor Will have me thinking such filth and gauge my eyes. Youâd be damned to be one of us girl Faced with a dodoâs conundrum Ah, I felt like I could just fly But nothingâll happen every time I try. A dual tone under wall Selfish fool and hoped youâd save us all Never dreamt of such sterile hands, You keep them folded in your lap, And raise them up to beg for scraps, You know, he's holding you down, With the tips of his fingers just the same, You'll be pulled from the ocean, But just a minute too late, Or changed by a potion, Weâll find a handsome young mate, For you to love. You'll be damned to pining through the windowpanes, You know you'll change your life for any ordinary Joe, And though your night will go on, Your nightmares only need a year or two to unfold.  Been in love since you were twenty-one, You haven't laughed since January, You try and make this up this is so much fun, But we know it to be quite contrary. Dare to be one of us, girl, Facing the Andrum's conundrum, Ah, I feel like I should just cry, But nothing happens every time I take one on the chin, Youâre humoring your cote, You don't know how long I've been, Watching the lantern dim, Starved of oxygen, So give me your hand, And let's jump out the window.

13,Backyard,Good Lovelies,238,happy,"We were sitting in our backyard, Waiting for the stars to show. But the city lights shine too far On and on the grey skies glow.  Took my bike out on Harvard Street, Rode up Atlers to Saint Clair, Started countin' cars surrounding me, My lungs burstin' for some cleaner air. It was sadder than the morning doe, Much funnier than a clown. But when push comes to shove, Oh, I still love this town. Do do do do Do do do do Do do do do do do do do  I was waitin' on the eastbound train, Headed out to see the suburbs, When I thought I heard my name. It was just a crazy lady slurrin' words. It was sadder than a weepin' willow. As silly as a dog with a bone. But when you ask me 'bout it, I'll still call this my home. Do do do do Do do do do do do do do Oh oh Do do do do Do do do do do do do do Early mornin' on a Saturday, The bustle wakes us up in bed. Construction, trucks, kids in the park at play, No quiet place to lay our heads. I was madder than the old hatter, I was crazy as the Cheshire Cat, But when we get to the heart of the matter, This is where I'll hang my hat. Do do do do Do do do do do do do do Oh oh Do do do do Do do do do oh  do do do do"

Number nine with my head on the bar. And itï¼s sad, but true. Out of cash and IOUï¼S. I've got desperate desires and unadmirable plans. My tongue will taste of gin and malicious intent. Bring you back to the bar. Get you out of the cold. A sober ,straight face gets you out of your clothes. And theyï¼re scared that we know all the crimes theyï¼ll commit. Who theyï¼ll kiss before they get home. I will lie awake. Lie for fun and fake the way I hold you. Let you fall for every empty word I say. Barely conscious in the door where you stand. Your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes your demands. You laugh at every word, trying hard to be cute. I almost feel sorry for what Iï¼m gonna do. And your hair smells of smoke. Who will cast the first stone? You can sin or spend the night all alone. Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold In the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone. Youï¼re using all your looks that youï¼ve thrown from the start. If you let me have my way, I swear Iï¼ll tear you apart. Cause itï¼s all you can be.  Youï¼re a drunk and youï¼re scared. Itï¼s ladies night. All the girls drink for free. I will lie awake. And lie for fun and fake the way I hold you. Let you fall for every empty word I say.  I will lie awake.  And lie for fun and fake the way I hold you. Let you fall for every empty word I say.  I will lie awake. And lie for fun and fake the way I hold you. Let you fall for every empty word I say. "

8,A Thousand Kisses Deep,Leonard Cohen,386,relaxed,"The ponies run, the girls are young, The odds are there to beat. You win a while, and then it's done Your little winning streak. And summoned now to deal With your invincible defeat, You live your life as if it's real, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed, I'm back on Boogie Street. You lose your grip, and then you slip Into the Masterpiece. And maybe I had miles to drive, And promises to keep: You ditch it all to stay alive, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  And sometimes when the night is slow, The wretched and the meek, We gather up our hearts and go, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  Confined to sex, we pressed against The limits of the sea: I saw there were no oceans left For scavengers like me. I made it to the forward deck. I blessed our remnant fleet And then consented to be wrecked, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed, I'm back on Boogie Street. I guess they won't exchange the gifts That you were meant to keep. And quiet is the thought of you, The file on you complete, Except what we forgot to do, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  And sometimes when the night is slow, The wretched and the meek, We gather up our hearts and go, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  The ponies run, the girls are young, The odds are there to beat...  You win a while, and then it's done Your little winning streak. And summoned now to deal With your invincible defeat, You live your life as if it's real A Thousand Kisses Deep.  "
